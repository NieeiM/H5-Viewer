- **Search** — Find entities across the entire file tree

## Remote Optimization

This is a fork of [vscode-h5web](https://github.com/silx-kit/vscode-h5web) with a redesigned architecture for remote development.

### The Problem

The original extension transfers **the entire HDF5 file** from the remote server to the local browser for parsing. A 500 MB file means 500 MB of network transfer before anything renders. Files over 2 GB cannot be opened at all.

### The Solution

H5 Viewer runs the HDF5 parser (h5wasm) on the **remote server** (Extension Host) and sends only the requested data slices to the local webview via VS Code's message passing. The file never leaves the server.

| | Original | H5 Viewer |
|---|---|---|
| Open a 500 MB file | Transfer 500 MB, then parse | Parse on server, transfer ~10 KB metadata |
| Switch dataset | Instant (in memory) | RPC request (~ms latency) |
| File size limit | 2 GB | **None** |
| Remote experience | Slow | Fast |

## MATLAB .mat File Support (Experimental)

> **Note:** MAT file support is experimental and has not been thoroughly tested. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/NieeiM/H5-Viewer/issues).

| MAT Version | Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **v7.3** | Full (on-demand loading) | HDF5-based, same fast experience as .h5 files |
| **v5 / v7** | Full (loads entire file) | Legacy binary format, parsed with mat-for-js |
| **v4** | Not supported | Prompt to resave as v7.3 |

For MAT v5/v7 files, a banner reminds you that the entire file is loaded into memory. For large files, resave in MATLAB with `save('file.mat', '-v7.3')` for better performance.

## EEG .cnt File Support (Experimental)

> **Note:** CNT file support is experimental and has not been thoroughly tested. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/NieeiM/H5-Viewer/issues).

| Format | Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Neuroscan CNT** | Full (on-demand loading) | Binary format from SCAN/SynAmps/NuAmps systems. Random access, no file size limit |
| **ANT Neuro CNT** | Full (epoch-based loading) | RIFF container with RAW3 compression from eego/waveguard systems. Decompressed per-epoch |

Format is auto-detected from the file header. Each EEG channel is exposed as a 1D dataset (physical values in µV). Events/triggers are listed under `/events`.

## Supported File Extensions

The viewer opens automatically for: `.h5`, `.hdf`, `.hdf5`, `.hf5`, `.mat`, `.cnt`, `.nx`, `.nxs`, `.nx5`, `.nexus`, `.cxi`, `.nc`, `.nc4`, `.loom`, `.jld2`, `.h5ebsd`, `.edaxh5`, `.oh5`, `.dream3d`, `.geoh5`, `.h5oina`, `.h5ad`.

For other extensions, right-click the file and select **Open With... > H5 Viewer (any extension)**.

To set H5 Viewer as default for additional extensions:

```json
"workbench.editorAssociations": {
  "*.foo": "h5viewer.viewer"
}
```

## Audio Data Support (Experimental)

> **Note:** Audio support is experimental and has not been thoroughly tested. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/NieeiM/H5-Viewer/issues).

The viewer automatically detects audio data inside HDF5/MAT files and shows a collapsible Audio Player panel at the bottom:

**Encoded audio blobs** — Datasets named with audio extensions (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.aac`, `.m4a`, `.opus`). Content is decoded using the browser's `AudioContext.decodeAudioData()`.

**PCM sample arrays** — 1D or 2D numeric datasets that look like raw audio (e.g. shape `[160000]` or `[2, 160000]`). Sample rate is read from attributes (`sample_rate`, `sampleRate`, etc.) or defaults to 44100 Hz.

Features: playback controls (play/pause, seek, volume), waveform visualization (Canvas 2D), and spectrogram visualization (FFT via ooura library). Large datasets trigger a warning before loading.

## NumPy .npy Support (Experimental)

> **Note:** NPY support is experimental. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/NieeiM/H5-Viewer/issues).

Datasets named with `.npy` extension inside HDF5/MAT files are automatically recognized as embedded NumPy arrays. The NPY binary format (v1.0/v2.0/v3.0) is parsed transparently — the viewer shows the actual array shape, dtype, and data instead of raw bytes. Supports all standard NumPy dtypes (int8-64, uint8-64, float16-64, bool). The parsed array is displayed using the standard Line/Heatmap/Matrix visualizations.

## JSON Viewer (Experimental)

> **Note:** JSON support is experimental. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/NieeiM/H5-Viewer/issues).

Datasets named with `.json` extension are displayed in a collapsible JSON Viewer panel with syntax highlighting, pretty-printing (auto-formats compact JSON to indented), word wrap toggle, and copy-to-clipboard.

## Compression Plugins

Supported HDF5 compression filters: **Blosc**, **Blosc2**, **Bitshuffle**, **BZIP2**, **JPEG**, **LZ4**, **LZF**, **ZFP**, **Zstandard**.

Plugins are loaded automatically on the server side — no configuration needed.

## Platform Support

The extension is fully cross-platform. Both the HDF5 parser and compression plugins are compiled to WebAssembly, so a single package works on **x86_64** and **ARM64** (Linux, macOS, Windows).
